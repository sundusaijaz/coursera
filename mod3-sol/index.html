        <h3>CHICKEN</h3>
        <p>
        We're guessing you made a lot of hard-boiled eggs this weekend. This week, you'll serve them in various dinners throughout the week (none of which include egg salad, we promise).And if you ended up throwing all of your eggs out after Sunday's egg hunt, we have a new way to hard-boil a lot of them at once: by steaming them instead. (That’s right, we said steam them—stick with us here!).
        Some of those eggs will be served on top of Italian-ish polenta bowls, and others will add extra protein to a quick-and-easy ramen. The rest of the week you'll welcome spring in a big way, with a deconstructed chicken Caesar, crowd-pleasing quesadillas, and a white pizza topped with seasonal vegetables.
